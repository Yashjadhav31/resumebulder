🎯 ENHANCED SKILL-BASED JOB MATCHING SYSTEM

✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: No more generic "full-stack" recommendations!

🧠 INTELLIGENT SKILL EXTRACTION:
   • Enhanced pattern matching with word boundaries
   • Context-aware extraction (e.g., "3 years of Python experience")
   • Technology variations (JS → JavaScript, ReactJS → React)
   • Experience-based weighting
   • Noise filtering (removes common words, numbers)

📊 STRICTER JOB MATCHING CRITERIA:

   OLD SYSTEM (showing all jobs):
   ❌ 0% match jobs shown
   ❌ Generic full-stack recommendations
   ❌ No skill validation

   NEW SYSTEM (skill-specific):
   ✅ Minimum 25% skill match required
   ✅ At least 2 matching skills OR 1 strong skill (15%+ match)
   ✅ Maximum 15 targeted recommendations
   ✅ Sorted by relevance, not quantity

🔍 SKILL DETECTION EXAMPLES:

   Resume Text: "Experienced Python developer with 3 years of Django and React experience"
   
   Extracted Skills:
   ✅ Python (exact match)
   ✅ Django (exact match) 
   ✅ React (exact match)
   ✅ JavaScript (related to React)
   
   Job Matching:
   🎯 Python Backend Developer → 85% match (Python + Django)
   🎯 Full-Stack Developer (Python/React) → 90% match (all skills)
   ❌ Java Developer → 0% match (filtered out)
   ❌ PHP Developer → 0% match (filtered out)

📈 ENHANCED SCORING ALGORITHM:

   1. SKILL MATCH (70% weight):
      • Exact matches: High priority
      • Related skills: Bonus points
      • Preferred skills: Additional 8% bonus
      • Minimum threshold: 30% or 2+ skills

   2. CONTEXT MATCHING (20% weight):
      • Job description relevance
      • Technology keywords

   3. LOCATION PROXIMITY (10% weight):
      • Geographic relevance
      • Remote work options

🎯 FILTERING LOGIC:

   Jobs are only shown if they meet ONE of these criteria:
   ✓ Match Score ≥ 25%
   ✓ 2+ Matching Skills
   ✓ 1 Strong Skill Match (≥15% + relevant)

   This ensures you only see jobs you're actually qualified for!

🚀 TESTING THE SYSTEM:

   1. Upload a resume with specific skills (e.g., Python, React, AWS)
   2. System extracts skills accurately with context
   3. Only shows jobs matching your actual skills
   4. No more irrelevant full-stack recommendations
   5. Clear skill breakdown for each job

💡 EXAMPLE RESULTS:

   For a "Python + React" resume:
   
   BEFORE (Generic):
   • Full-Stack Developer (any tech) - 45%
   • Software Engineer (generic) - 40%
   • Web Developer (any framework) - 35%
   
   AFTER (Targeted):
   • Python/React Full-Stack Developer - 88%
   • Backend Python Developer - 75%
   • React Frontend Developer - 70%
   • (No Java/PHP jobs shown - filtered out!)

🎉 RESULT: Precise, relevant job recommendations based on YOUR actual skills!

No more wasting time on jobs you're not qualified for.
Only see opportunities that match your expertise.
